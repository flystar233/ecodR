Description: Implements the ECOD (Empirical Cumulative Distribution-Based Outlier 
    Detection) algorithm for fast and parameter-free anomaly detection. ECOD uses 
    empirical cumulative distribution functions to compute tail probabilities for 
    each feature and aggregates them to identify outliers. The method is extremely 
    fast, requires no parameter tuning, and provides interpretable results through 
    feature-level tail probabilities.
